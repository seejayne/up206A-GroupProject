# Mapping Affordable Housing and Climate Change Adaptation Investments
Link to our project proposal:
https://github.com/seejayne/up206A-GroupProject/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md

## Roles (only for groups)
Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."

### Laura 
- Reaching out to research librarian to get more data. 
- Focus on environmental data exploration

### Jayne 
- Data Wrangling 
- Will work on starting to explore the TCAC data next
- Focus on the housing data exploration

## Status update
Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
- We have met consistently every on Tuesdays and worked together on the assignments.
- We did data exploration together and found some datasets, but still need to finalize the sources.
- We have submitted our assignments early
- Paired programming on assignments seems to be working well

## Data update: 
Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
We are using data from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee website, the CalEnviroScreen data of “disadvantaged communities”; the California open Data portal Stormwater projects dataset.  We are currently exploring more data sets for the climate adaptation investments as follows 
- http://solar.energyatlas.ucla.edu/  - (LA county only :/) 
- http://solar.energyatlas.ucla.edu 
- http://planning.lacounty.gov/solar  
- https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/
- https://pw.lacounty.gov/epd/cleanla/

## Concerns: 
There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."

### Minor concerns
- Balancing our understanding of the coding process and not contributing as much as Jayne
- Laura is still grasping the coding concepts and learning slowly
- Still not sure exactly what we will be able to map out since we haven’t tried with our data yet
- Finding more data for the environmental investments 
 
No major concerns so far!
