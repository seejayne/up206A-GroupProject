## Note: For the midterm project we have two jupyter notebooks

- AffordableHousing (1).ipynb
- (add Laura's notebook filename here)

Jayne worked on the Affordable Housing one while Laura focused on the Climate one.

(we'd like to move old notebooks to another folder, but haven't found a way to do so)

Our presentation is available here:
